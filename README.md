#Crude Oil Price Prediction

##Problem Statement: Predicting Crude Oil Price using Time Series Analysis
Addressing the challenge of forecasting crude oil prices involves navigating through various methods and tuning numerous hyperparameters specific to each method.

For this task, I've opted for Time Series Forecasting using the Prophet library in Python.

Time series forecasting poses complexity due to the multitude of available methods and their associated hyperparameters. Prophet, an open-source library developed by Facebook, offers a solution tailored for making forecasts on univariate time series datasets. It's designed to be user-friendly and can automatically determine optimal hyperparameters, aiming to generate accurate forecasts for data exhibiting trends and seasonal patterns by default.

##Project Overview
In this project, I'll guide you through the usage of the Prophet library for time series forecasting.

Upon completion, you'll gain insights into:

##Prophet: An open-source library from Facebook, specialized in automatic forecasting for univariate time series data.
Fitting Prophet Models: Learn how to fit Prophet models and utilize them for both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts.
Evaluation: Explore techniques for evaluating the performance of a Prophet model on a hold-out dataset.
By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively leverage the Prophet library for accurate time series forecasting in the context of predicting crude oil prices.
